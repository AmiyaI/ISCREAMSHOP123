## About The Project
Welcome to the GitHub repository for PaireODees, a whimsical and innovative ice cream shop's website. This project was conceptualized and developed as a capstone project by a team of four students from FullStack Academy. It showcases our combined skills in web development, creativity in design, and our teamwork in bringing a playful concept to digital life.

As an essential part of our project, we chose AWS Amplify for hosting the website. This choice reflects our commitment to leveraging reliable and efficient cloud technology, ensuring the best possible online experience for visitors.
